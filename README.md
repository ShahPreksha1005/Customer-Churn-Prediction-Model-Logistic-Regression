# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using a dataset that includes various customer features. The primary technique employed for modeling is logistic regression, which is suitable for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Size**: The dataset contains a total of 768 entries with multiple features that indicate customer demographics, account information, and service usage.
- **Target Variable**: The target variable is the churn status (0 for not churned, 1 for churned).

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing numerical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices were used to understand the distribution of features and relationships with the target variable.

### 3. Modeling
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
- The logistic regression model was trained on the processed dataset to predict customer churn.
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to assess the performance of the model.

### 4. Results
- The final model achieved a notable accuracy of X% (insert actual accuracy here) on the validation set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting churn.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the factors influencing customer churn and highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in customer retention strategies. Future improvements could involve experimenting with advanced models, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy.
